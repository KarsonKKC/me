TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Last week of the class, more data project. Maps are finally coming out. Plotting the points onto the map. Visualising data with points and colors.
used functions, .plot() .shatter()
There is one thing I would like to plot if I had more time for the dataproject. Which is the map that links the fuel stations to fuel depots and calculate the distance.
