TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have understood the concept of coding and I have an understanding of how to think when I make the code. The main problem that I've encountered was to use the right code in the right area.
For example loops, in order to array the number i will need to use append. To lay them across I will need to use in range of (10), which means a number from 0-9. 10 numbers in total.
