TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week was confusing and tough, My head was every where and i could'nt figure out most of the commands.
But I've looked at it again and realised how the function works.
I copied both Super_asker and Not number rejecter to put it in the guessing game. It was fun to think how it is working.

I've also learnt how to use float('inf'), it means to find the infinity value in Python 3. It will allow the highest number. If you want it to be negative, just put - in front of inf.

This week is mainly about while loops and try, except.
