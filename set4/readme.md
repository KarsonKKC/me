TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In exercise 1, we used for loops to work out some of the exercises. This is a good practice from the previous exercise. However, Ben said this week 3 was probably the hardest. I DON'T THINK SO! but i'm liking coding more. Fun to learn.
