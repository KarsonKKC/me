TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week is self study week. More on data project.
However, anaconda has decided to stop working. Therefore took me a whole morning to reinstall my data project environment and locate the issue.
I have started my own venv for the data project. installed all the software needed in vs code.
